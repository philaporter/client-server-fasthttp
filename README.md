# client-server-fasthttp
### I'm trying something new
* I've created server/router/router.go and it wraps / extends the basic fasthttp server functionality

### Getting started
* `git clone https://github.com/philaporter/client-server-fasthttp.git`
* `go get -u github.com/valyala/fasthttp`
* navigate to server and run main.go
* navigate to client, double check the client/config.json to see if you want to change anything, then run main.go 
* Have you ever noticed that on Masterchef, the judges increasingly describe the food as being sexy if it's presented by a pretty lady?
